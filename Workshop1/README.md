## Random Highlights From The Workshop  

* Markup is used to structure & group information on your page; it should have no effect on the way your information is displayed (you should use HTML tags to structure your document)  
* CSS is in charge of formatting and manipulating how your information is displayed.
* CSS3 is AMAZING! It's also much more optimized than JavaScript. i.e if something can be done in CSS, you should ALWAYS do it in CSS  
* CSS3 have added so many cool features that previously you wouldn't be able to do without JavaScript. When you decide to animate anything in your page, for example, try to look up the CSS way of doing that, don't just settle for good-ol (slow) JavaScript  
* jQuery is a great mainstream choice when it comes to JavaScript frameworks, it will surely payoff if you decide to invest some time learning jQuery.
* Front-end is anything & everything that happens on the client-side (Browser)  
* Back-end is anything & everything that happens on the server-side
* A Full-stack Developer is the person who can do both Front & Back-end development  
* A good practice is to fully design the structure of your website before doing anything else. i.e write all the HTML needed, then start adding CSS & JS as required to change the way your document look & interact
