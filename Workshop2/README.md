## Random Highlights From The Workshop  

* The basic syntax for a CSS statement is: "Selector {Property : Value;}"  
* There are 3 kinds of selectors in CSS:
  * Elements (h1, p, etc.)  
  * Ids (#myID) (each ID can be used only once per html page)  
  * Classes (.myClass) (can be used on as many elements as needed)
* "@" is used for CSS definitions (ex: @keyframes)
* ":" is used for CSS selector related events (ex: .myClass:hover)
* Animations are performed in a keyframed way in CSS. Define a keyframe animation then apply it to a specific selector/event
* The are plenty of cool things that can be done in CSS. Always look up CSS references before making the decision of using other options (JavaScript, etc.)
* There are plenty of solid CSS-based frameworks on the internet; by all means, use them to make your life easier!
